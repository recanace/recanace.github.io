<div style="text-align: justify;">

Greetings! I am Chi Zhang (张驰，pronounced as *tʂɑŋ55 tʂʰʅ35*) , also go by Canace.

 I currently work in the Research and Development Group at iFLYTEK Co. LTD, focusing on multilingual speech and language technologies including TTS, ASR, and NLP. I am also involved in the development of voice products and conversational agents based on Large Language Models. I earned my Master's degree in *Linguistics - Language and Speech Intelligence Track* from the School of Informatics at Beijing Language and Culture University in 2021, under the guidance of Professor Jinsong Zhang (Ph.D. in Engineering). I completed my Bachelor’s degree in Chinese at Yunnan University in 2018.

My research interests lie in computational linguistics, language intelligence, and system design. I am committed to designing more efficient and expressive voice and language systems by incorporating a deeper understanding of natural speech and the cognitive processing mechanisms behind it. Among various related topics, I am particularly interested in how linguistic and psychological insights can inform machine learning architectures for real-world business scenarios, such as the protection and revitalization of low-resource languages, applications of vehicle voice assistants, human-computer collaboration in the workplace, LLM-based agents, and the execution of complex multi-agent systems.

In my free time away from work, I like to spend time traveling, wall-climbing, photographing, and practicing the guitar.
